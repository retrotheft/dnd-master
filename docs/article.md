# Dnd-Master: Lightweight, Powerful Drag-and-Drop for Svelte

Have you ever noticed that when it comes to drag and drop options, the choices seem to be:

- Use the Native Drag and Drop API (which everyone should do exactly once), or;
- Use this fully-featured library with a big detailed API to learn, and we hope you want to animate lists

There doesn't really seem to be a middle-ground: something that abstracts over the painful parts of the native experience, but that is also dead simple to use and flexible. Powerful, even.

So I made Dnd-Master; a minimal hooks-based solution that is extendable via middleware. And it's typesafe. In this article, I'll go over the basics of how it works and then show examples of two-way validation and a dynamic ghost element.

This is just meant to be a quick read so you can decide if it's right for you; for the full README, visit the [github repo](https://github.com/retrotheft/dnd-master).

## Dragging

To pass some data, use `dnd.draggable` to create an attachment, and attach it to an element:

```ts
const draggable = dnd.draggable("My data")
```

```html
<div {@attach draggable}>My data</div>
```

Creating a dropzone is almost the same, but pass it a callback instead of an object:

```ts
const dropzone = dnd.dropzone(data => console.log(data))
```

```html
<div {@attach dropzone}>Drop here</div>
```

That's pretty straightforward, but the real fun begins when we start using hooks:

```ts
let timesDropped = $state(0)

const draggable = dnd.draggable("My data", {
   drop: () => timesDropped++
})
```

Notice that here, we're running some drop-aware logic on the *data* side of things, without needing to connect anything to the drop callback, which might very well be in a different component.

Both the data and drop attachments can implement all the native drag events as hooks, as well as a couple of others, and middlewares can provide more.

## Middleware

**Dnd-Master** comes with two middlewares: **Validate** and **Ghost**. Let's quickly look at how to validate data, then we'll create a ghost element, and then we'll finish by implementing two-way validation and a dynamic ghost that responds to different dropzones.

### Validation

To validate data, use `assertData`. This function takes a predicate, and returns a validator function that also has a builder on it that replaces `dnd.draggable`. Like this:

```ts
const isString = dnd.assertData(data => typeof data === "string")

const dropzone = isString.soDrop(data => lastDropped = data)
// this will only run your drop callback if the predicate is true
```

You can also make your drop callback typesafe by using a type assertion in `assertData`:

```ts
const isString = dnd.assertData(
   (data): data is string => typeof data === "string"
)

const dropzone = isString.soDrop(data => lastDropped = data)
// now typescript knows data is a string!
```

I like this approach because it encourages me to use a feature that I always forget exists, without abstracting over it.

### Ghost

First, let's create an element to use as our ghost. We'll wrap it in `<template>` so it doesn't appear in the DOM:

```html
<template>
   <div class="ghost" bind:this={ghostElement}>üëª Ghost</div>
</template>
```

You could style this however you like. Now here's how to add it to the dragged element:

```ts
let ghostElement = $state<HTMLDivElement>()

const draggable = dnd.draggable("My item", {
   dragstart: () => dnd.setGhost(ghostElement)
})
```

We can just use the `dragstart` hook, as well as the `setGhost` function provided by the `ghost` middleware. Painless.

## Advanced Examples

### Two-way Validation

We already saw how to validate data. Here's how to validate a dropzone:

```ts
const isValidZone = dnd.assertZone(
   element => element.dataset.zone === "valid"
)

const draggable = isValidZone.soGive("My item")

// and let's validate some data again:
const isString = dnd.assertData(
   (data): data is string => typeof data === "string"
)

const dropzone = isString.soDrop(data => lastDropped = data)
```

```html
<div {@attach draggable}>My item</div>

<div data-zone="valid" {@attach dropzone}>Valid Dropzone</div>
```

Now both sides of the drag and drop flow will validate before passing the data.

### Dynamic Ghost

Here we want a ghost that will update when over different dropzones.

```ts
let defaultGhost = $state<HTMLDivElement>()
let validGhost = $state<HTMLDivElement>()
let invalidGhost = $state<HTMLDivElement>()

const isValidZone = dnd.assertZone(element =>
   element.dataset.zone === "valid"
)

const dynamicItem = isValidZone.soGive("Item with Dynamic Ghost", {
   dragstart: () => dnd.setGhost(defaultGhost),
   dragleave: () => dnd.setGhost(defaultGhost),
   dragover: (_event, element) => {
      isValidZone(element)
         ? dnd.setGhost(validGhost)
         : dnd.setGhost(invalidGhost)
   }
})

const dropzone = dnd.dropzone(data => console.log(data))
```

```html
<div {@attach draggable}>My item</div>

<div data-zone="valid" {@attach dropzone}>Valid Dropzone</div>
<div data-zone="invalid" {@attach dropzone}>Invalid Dropzone</div>

<template>
   <div bind:this={defaultGhost}>üëª Ghost</div>
   <div bind:this={validGhost}>‚úÖ Drop here!</div>
   <div bind:this={invalidGhost}>‚ùå Can't park here mate</div>
</template>
```

And that's it! Notice that we didn't need to create two separate dropzones; all our validation is data-based in the element data attributes. You could of course choose a different method, the data attribute approach is nothing to do with the library itself, just an idiomatic way of doing it.

Hopefully that's enough to make you interested in trying out **Dnd-Master**. You can find it on [github](https://github.com/retrotheft/dnd-master) and npm. It's open source, MIT Licensed, and ready to be expanded with more middleware!

If you use it, let me know how it goes!
